# Welcome to My GitHub Profile



## About Me

My name is Tom and I have a passion for data. I made this github to showcase my work, practice and stay sharp coding in languages I don't use daily, 
and most importantly to have fun. In my professional life I've been crafting data solutions and optimizing processes as a consultant since 2018. 
My journey is defined by a commitment to bridging the gap between technology and business needs, delivering impactful results through strategic 
thinking and effective collaboration.


## Expertise

- **Data Engineering**: Proficient in developing and implementing efficient ETL processes, automating data workflows, and ensuring data integrity.
- **Collaboration**: Experienced in cross-functional teamwork, translating business requirements into technical solutions, and driving project success.
- **Data Quality**: Skilled in data cleansing, validation, and monitoring, resulting in improved data accuracy and reliability.
- **Programming**: Proficient in SQL, Python, Spark, and R, with a knack for using these tools to transform data into actionable insights.
- **Tools**: Experienced with SAP Data Services, DataBricks, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, GitHub, and more.


## Featured Repositories

For now simple projects written in either .c (C) or .py (Python) are scattered around. My source of inspiration is Harvard's CS50 class and
Eric Mattes' book "Python Crash Course"
